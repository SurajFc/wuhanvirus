    <h2 id="typical">Typical Symptoms</h2>
    <p>COVID-19 typically causes flu-like symptoms including a fever and cough.</p>
    <p>In some patients - particularly the elderly and others with other chronic health conditions - these symptoms can develop into pneumonia, with chest tightness, chest pain, and shortness of breath.</p>
    <p>
      It seems to
      <strong>start with a fever</strong>,
      <strong>followed by a dry cough</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>After a week, it can lead to shortness of breath,</strong> with about 20% of patients requiring hospital treatment.
      <br />
      <br />Notably, the COVID-19 infection
      <strong>rarely seems to cause a runny nose</strong>, sneezing, or sore throat (these symptoms have been observed in only about 5% of patients).
      <strong>Sore throat, sneezing, and stuffy nose are most often signs of a cold</strong>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="mild">80% of cases are mild</h2>
    <p>Based on all 72,314 cases of COVID-19 confirmed, suspected, and asymptomatic cases in China as of February 11, a paper by the Chinese CCDC released on February 17 and published in the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology has found that:</p>
    <ul class="story-body__unordered-list">
      <li class="story-body__list-item">
        <strong>80.9% of infections are mild</strong> (with flu-like symptoms) and
        <strong>can recover at home</strong>.
      </li>
      <li class="story-body__list-item">
        <strong>13.8% are severe</strong>, developing severe diseases including
        <strong>pneumonia</strong>and
        <strong>shortness of breath</strong>.
      </li>
      <li class="story-body__list-item">
        <strong>4.7% as critical</strong>and can include:
        <strong>respiratory failure</strong>,
        <strong>septic shock</strong>, and
        <strong>multi-organ failure</strong>.
      </li>
      <li class="story-body__list-item">in about 2% of reported cases the virus is fatal.</li>
      <li class="story-body__list-item">Risk of death increases the older you are.</li>
      <li class="story-body__list-item">Relatively few cases are seen among children.</li>

    <p>That said, some otherwise healthy people do seem to develop a severe form of pneumonia after being infected by the virus. The reason for this is being investigated as we try to learn more about this new virus.</p>

      Using available preliminary data, the Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission published on Feb. 28 by WHO,
      <sup>
        [
        <a href="#ref-5">5</a>]
      </sup> which is based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases, observed the following median time from symptoms onset to clinical recovery:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>mild cases</strong>: approximately
        <strong>2 weeks</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>severe or critical</strong> disease:
        <strong>3 - 6 weeks</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        time from onset to the development of severe disease (including hypoxia):
        <strong>1 week</strong>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Among patients who have died, the time from symptom onset to outcome ranges from 2 - 8 weeks.</p>
    <h2>Symptoms observed in hospitalized patients with COVID-19</h2>Below we list the symptoms, with
    <strong>percentages representing the proportion of patients displaying that symptom</strong>
    , as observed in hospitalized patients tested and identified as having laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection. These findings refer to
    <strong>hospitalized patients</strong>, therefore generally representing
    <strong>serious</strong> or critical cases. The
    <strong>majority of cases of COVID-19 (about 80%) is mild</strong>
